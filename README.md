## 📝 Overview
Welcome to my Deep Learning repository! This collection showcases my journey in Deep Learning through various projects and study notes. Each project demonstrates the application of neural networks and deep learning techniques to solve real-world problems. From foundational concepts to advanced models, this repository covers a wide spectrum of topics.

## 📁 Projects
### 📖 00 - Learning DL
Contains fundamental notebooks documenting my learning process in Deep Learning.

### 💡 01 - Credit Score Classification Project
This project focuses on classifying credit scores into three categories (**Good, Standard, Poor**) using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**. Key aspects include:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature selection, and scaling.
- **Model Optimization**: Implementing techniques like **early stopping** and **dropout**.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measuring performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- 🐍 Python
- 🔥 PyTorch & TensorFlow
- 📊 NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- 🖼️ OpenCV
